    snippet: 'I want to visit the highest floor to fully conquer my fear of heights. Plus, the view is most likely breathtaking. It is not a surprise that it held the title of the tallest freestanding structure in the world for 32 years. In addition to its height, it also houses several observation decks, a revolving restaurant, and a glass floor that offers a unique perspective of the city below.',

    snippet: 'I have heard that the ROM has free entry every third Tuesday night of each month, which is a great opportunity to explore its vast collections without spending a dime. However, it might take a while to explore all of them due to the fact that it houses about 18 million artifacts and specimens, making it one of the largest museums in North America. With over 1 million visitors annually, it is also the most popular museum in Canada.',

It is also a popular filming location for movies and TV shows while it is not operating as a venue for holding events and a museum. Despite being over 100 years old, it is not reported to be haunted(yet). However, they do offer ghost tours during Halloween, which could be a fun experience.',
